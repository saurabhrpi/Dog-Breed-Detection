# Dog-Breed-Detection
To create a model that detects the breed of the dog when its image is supplied.

The project accepts any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it provides an estimate of the dog's breed. Additionally, if a human is detected, it provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling(!).  

The image below displays potential sample output of the project.
